EZFAIR
=======

The project seeks to meet the following objectives:
  1. To implement a virtual queue system which would reduce time spent physically standing in line
  2. To facilitate digital sharing of resumes
  3. To provide recruiters a method to shortlist candidates based on resume
These ideas combined would be a powerful tool at university career fairs to smoothen the process of information exchange.

## Features
The EZFair application can be used by both students and recruiters and there are several features that can help make the career fair more efficient by reducing the chaos that generally takes place.

1. <b>Resume and profile upload </b> <br>
The students are able to fill in their profiles and upload their resume before coming to the career fair. This helps students as they don’t have to carry multiple copies of their resume to the career fair. 

2. <b>Join virtual queues </b> <br>
Currently, students have to stand in long queues, potentially for several hours and yet attend only a few companies in a day. Using the EZFair android application, the students can join the virtual queues of the companies they wish to attend during the career fair. They get a token number when they join a queue from and they also know how many people are ahead of them in the queue. They can also leave a queue at any time if they do not want to meet the recruiter from that company.

3. <b>Notifications </b> <br>
The students are notified about 15 minutes before their turn is about to arrive, and then they can go and join the company’s queue physically. This saves a lot of the students’ time and gives them a chance to attend more number of companies. The students can also decide to leave the queue at the time of notification if they feel that they will not be able to make it or
are no longer interested. This will move the student out of the company’s queue and another student will take their place.

4. <b>Student profile views </b> <br>
During a career fair, a recruiter has only a minute or so to peruse through a student’s resume and has to learn as much information about their interests and skills during a short talk. This is not an easy task and recruiters generally look for some basic criteria like degree, major or GPA. Using EZFair, they can view these details directly on their tablets which helps to make the conversation with the student more concise and productive.

5. <b>Student resume views </b> <br>
Recruiters collect hard copies of resumes of interested students which they have to manually sort later. Sometimes, they even scan or take photos of the resume and upload them to the company database. EZFair provides them with the digital copies of the resumes for direct download which saves paper and time. 

6. <b>Star good candidates</b> <br>
It is difficult for a recruiter to remember all the students they might have talked to during the career fair. There might have been some students who the recruiter liked and would like to know more about them. EZFair provides recruiters with an option to mark students as Starred which can be viewed later again. These students can then be contacted by the recruiter for
proceeding further in the process.
